        <h2>TCK Camp 2025</h2>
        <p>
            2025 will mark the tenth year in a row that we have hosted third culture kids from all over 
            Aotearoa and the world for a camp that is all about special people just like you! We think this 
            kaupapa is the bees knees, and apparently so do our campers! We’ve been a fast-growing community 
            since camp began in 2016, and it has been an incredible blessing to get to walk with you and 
            prepare each group of young people for what lies ahead - whether you are returning overseas or 
            are settling in New Zealand long-term, with your family or on your own - and to help you settle 
            into life as weird people living in a pretty weird world! 
            <br><br>
            Our prayer is that every third culture kid will act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God 
            through whatever doors you may encounter. We could write all day about this, but we’ll give you a 
            snapshot of what camp looks like down below. If you’re still a bit iffy about registering for camp 
            (or your teen if you’re a parent/guardian), the best way to find out some more is to flick us a 
            message over on the <a href="contact.html">contact page,</a>
            <br><br>
            Ka kite anō, see you soon!

                    One of the most important things about TCK Camp is you! So, who is ‘you’? A TCK (third culture kid) 
                    is generally someone who has spent (part of) their childhood living in a country and culture outside 
                    of their own birth country, eventually blending the cultures of both places into a new ‘third culture’ 
                    that is neither fully home nor away. In fact, what is ‘home’ and what is ‘away’ may likely be a difficult 
                    concept for you. We're looking for those TCKs entering New Zealand school year 10 (aged 14/15ish) and 
                    above to join us. If after reading this, you're still not sure if you (or your child) fits the bill, 
                    just <a href="mailto:hello@tckcamp.com">flick us an e-mail</a> and we can help you out!

                    the 22nd of January. If you are a parent and you'd like to stay for the parents’ lunch on Saturday 
                    when you come to pick up your young people, you are more than welcome to do so! Just let us know on the 
                    registration form. This lunch was a fantastic time last year, and we were very excited to see so many third 
                    culture parents connect with each other over some great kai!

                    Eastwest College of Intercultural Studies is the host of TCK Camp, and camp takes place on its campus in 
                    the lusciously green Gordonton, just outside of Hamilton, Waikato (you can <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/k1p1V2jBTLyKBGAp9" target="_blank">find it here</a>). 
                    If you (or your child) might need a hand to get to Eastwest, <a href="mailto:hello@tckcamp.com">let us know</a>; 
                    we have people traveling in from all over the country who may be able to help you out with a ride. Camp takes 
                    place during Eastwest's summer break, so there are vacant student housing units in which the campers are 
                    accommodated along with one of their leaders. These are pretty flash for a summer camp - plenty of hot 
                    showers and comfy mattresses for all!

                    The two main focuses of camp are first worshipping God together in all of our uniqueness; and second, 
                    building a strong TCK community here in Aotearoa. We have a diverse leadership team (who are themselves TCKs) 
                    to help facilitate this, but what we've experienced in the past is that most campers do an amazing job 
                    of including each other and looking out for one another already. We have brilliant guest speakers come 
                    and run seminars and smaller break-out sessions with us that help you better understand the things you 
                    might be facing upon returning to Aotearoa, help you realize that you aren't so alone in feeling the way 
                    that you do, and give you some very practical ways to deal with those feelings and experiences. We worship 
                    together in a way that is so unique to TCKs, and each year our worship team is made up of amazing young 
                    people who just come with a voice or an instrument and jump right on in. 
                    <br><br>
                    We run games and activities (like bonfire night, movie night, and beach trip day, plus way more!) to 
                    engage you with those around you and enjoy your summer, and we still make sure there is plenty of free time 
                    on campus to get to know some incredible people. The food is not at all bad either, and there's plenty of it! 
                    Delicious breakfasts, lunches, and dinners are provided, as well as other snacks throughout the day; we try 
                    our best to accommodate your special dietary requirements, too, so let us know on the registration form if 
                    you have any of those.

            If you've read through all of this and still have some unanswered questions for us, head over to the contact 
            page and fill out the contact form, or fire an e-mail at us. We look forward to seeing you in January! Kia tau 
            te rangimarie
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Plenty of clothes to last five days, including some that can potentially get dirty, and something that you can swim in</li>
            <li>Towels (shower and beach) and toiletries (think toothbrush + toothpaste, deodorant, shampoo + conditioner, soap)</li>
            <li>Something to sleep in, like a sleeping bag or a duvet, and a pillow or two</li>
            <li>If you like board/card games, you'll love camp! Feel free to bring some along, but make sure you note down somewhere on them that they belong to you</li>
            <li>A Bible, and something to take notes with; phones are fine, but can serve to be a distraction at times so it's best to bring a notepad/notebook + a pen instead</li>
            <li>Your very honest self</li>
            <li>Something that makes you, you! If you're into art, bring your artsy stuff along! Music? Bring an instrument! Photography? A camera! You get the picture.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Just a quick note: anything that you do bring along we cannot be liable for if anything happens to it. So if 
            you bring something (especially something expensive like a camera), you've gotta be prepared to look out for 
            it throughout camp.
